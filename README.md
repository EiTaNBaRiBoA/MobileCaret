# Mobile Caret for Godot 4 (WIP)

Godot 4 plugin for customizable, touch-friendly carets on mobile devices. Improves text input visibility and selection ease.

## Motivation

Godot's built-in caret can be challenging to see and interact with on smaller screens, particularly on mobile devices. This plugin aims to address that by providing a customizable solution for a more user-friendly caret experience.

## Features

* **Custom Caret:** Use any `TextureButton` as your text caret, providing greater visibility and touch target area.
* **Offset Control:** Fine-tune the position of the custom caret relative to the text for optimal placement.
* **Text Selection Support:** The plugin seamlessly handles text selection, allowing you to drag the custom caret to adjust the selection range.
* **Theme Compatibility:** Works with various themes and font sizes, ensuring visual consistency.

## Installation

* **Coming Soon!** Detailed installation instructions will be provided as development progresses. 

## Usage

* The plugin automatically detects when a `LineEdit` or `TextEdit` gains focus and replaces the default caret with your custom one.
* During text selection, you can drag the custom caret to adjust the selection range, making it easier to interact with on touchscreens.

## Important Notes

* **Work in Progress:** This plugin is actively being developed. There might be some edge cases or bugs that need to be addressed.
* **Feedback and Contributions:** Your feedback and contributions are highly valued! This plugin is a work in progress, pull requests are always welcome!
